# Traffic

### Description

This program simulates an urban traffic with some rules to be followed.

Cars are initially generated in random positions on the map. Each car is represented by a letter.

They will follow the road direction defined in the image map.png

There are traffic light in the crosses to avoid collisions.
Cars must stop if there's a red light or a car stopped in front of it.

Each time a car stops, a log is added to the occurrences .txt file.
